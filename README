OpenBSD Security - Attack Mitigations

The environment for userland application in OpenBSD tries to be an
unpleasant place for attackers.  Most of the binary exploitation
mitigation are listed on http://www.openbsd.org/innovations.html .
This talk will give a deeper insight in a bunch of them.  What kind
of attacks should they stop and how do mitigations work together?

These OpenBSD features were not written all at once, they evolved
during the past 20 years.  What was necessary to implement them,
and what had to be done that modern POSIX compatible software runs
fine on OpenBSD?  You have to hit the small line between things
that 3rd party software expects, and the ABI allows to do.  There
was a lot of pain for the ports maintainers to fix the fallout.

Alexander Bluhm is an OpenBSD developer since 2007.  His main area
of work is the network stack.  In the recent years focus was on
multi processor performance.  He is employed at genua, a German
firewall manufacturer, who is using OpenBSD an a secure and stable
base for its products.  Other areas of interest are the errata
process, testing, maintaining Perl ports, and fixing all kinds of
bugs.
